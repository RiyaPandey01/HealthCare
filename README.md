Project Title: A Smart Enquiry FAQ Chatbot embedded in a healthcare website

Problem Statement/Opportunity: A Healthcare company wants to build a front-end prototype for their convenience as it is very difficult to get physical consultation with a doctor in case of any acute or minor health issues these days due to the increasing COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed idea is to make a medical website which allows e-appointments and has an enquiry FAQ chatbot developed using Azure Bot service which will provide information about the disease and their respective symptoms and supply basic details about the disease before consulting a doctor for customer help.

Project Description: To lead a good and healthy life healthcare is extremely much important. The idea of the project is to make a sample prototype of a health care website for a medical company with the help of HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT(cdn), BOOTSTRAP. The primary objective of the sample prototype is to provide E-Consultation and to book E-Appointments with a doctor without going to the clinic physically. An enquiry FAQ chatbot using Azure Bot service has been embedded in a website named "HealthCare" which will provide information about the disease and their respective symptoms including the symptoms of Corona and other diseases like malaria and diabetes before consulting a doctor. Since the increasing COVID-19 pandemic it is quite tough for people to get medical assistance any time. To scale back the healthcare costs and improve accessibility to medical knowledge this medical chatbot is made for customer help. Features: 1.Easy access to correct basic medical/disease(Example-COVID, Malaria, Diabetes)details anywhere and everywhere. 2.This will reduce hospital wait times, consultation times, unnecessary treatments. 3.User-friendly BOT and easily accessible over a website. We are using Microsoft Azure Technologies along with GitHub to complete this project.
